Though there are so many factors causing my procrastination,  perfectionism is one of the primary reasons I find it difficult to start doing it.

We have so many decisions to make during the day; perfectionism makes me hesitate and consumes energy in my brain. Therefore, I have this pre-programming procedure to make my life easier and try to spend more time doing actual work.
## Principle
- Less is more 
- time values most
- Do not let perfectionism stop you from achieving. Complete >> perfection

## Action and pre-plan

- When choosing from two items, choose the right (hand) one. Ôºàüëè homophonic punsÔºâ
- Follow a routine. Take coffee, for example; if I need energy or cannot pee conveniently, I pick a latte; otherwise, I like an Americano.
	- What if I try something different?  I have [Exploring Friday](Exploring%20Friday.md), which is the day I will try something different.
	- My partner tends to try new flavours of drinks and snacks; then, I stay in my comfort zone to hedge the risk.
- Timing box method
	- When writingÔºå as my thoughts and ideas span, it is a scope creeping.
		- Also, check the spelling and grammar **after** writing rather than while doing writing.s
- When so many software offering similar functions, choose
	- The most popular one
	- Just enough
		- Knowing what I need
			- Key features I care
		- Be wary of the traps of all-in-one, such as higher learning curves, flashy features, etc.
- Routines and schema
	- such as PARA files/folders 

## Reasons why I want to be perfect
- I want to produce high-quality outcomes. 
- Information.  I want to get more information and try to make the best practice, but searching for information distracts me.
- Loss aversion. 
	- I want to save money but sometimes spend more time.
	- I want to take advantage of a product/software while spending more time on rarely used features.
