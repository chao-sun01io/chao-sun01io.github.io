My motives for writing.

As the first post on my new site, it should tell something about my motives for writing.

## Why do I write?

1. **Output as a way to learn**. Inspired by Feynman's techniques, I explain complex concepts or knowledge in simple words if I need to understand something deeply. As a programmer, I must learn, which I would love to do continuously. But I also care about how to learn fast and efficiently. Some key concepts and core knowledge matter most in programming, and writing is an excellent technique to understand the knowledge better.
    
2. **Display work and portfolio**. During the job hunt process, I realize that the best CV is a portfolio. It might take time to accumulate a persuasive portfolio. What I enjoy most is the inner reward of making something (either writing an article or writing code).
    
3. **Practice English writing skills**. I recently relocated to the UK, a new challenge in my career and life, therefore it is important for me a non-native speaker practice English. Writing is an efficient way of practicing. I have a Chinese blogÂ [https://01io.tech](https://01io.tech/), running for about 2 years and now I started this English (maybe bilingual later) site to try to post my writings.

## Philosophy

I like the idea from **digital garden**, that I don't have to be perfect for my posts. I have hundreds of time tried to be perfect but haven't actually get things done. see [A Checklist for a perfectionist and procrastinate](./A%20Checklist%20for%20a%20perfectionist%20and%20procrastinate.md).
- each posts of the sites can be imperfect and incomplete
- with time goes, the garden is developing and plants (posts here) are growingP
## Tools

I used to set up a dynamic personal website with WordPress and ran for over 2 years. But I find a static website is much easier to maintain and let me focus on writing.

After some research, I decide to use Hugo to generate the sites from markdown and host on github.io.
